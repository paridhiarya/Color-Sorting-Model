# Color and Weight Sensing Object Sorting Model

The Color and Weight Sensing Object Sorting Model is a hardware and software system designed to sort objects into four bins based on their color and weight. This project integrates various components, including Arduino Uno, Node-MCU, HX711 Load Cell, and others, to create an efficient sorting system. Additionally, it features an Android-based interface for recording and displaying object descriptions and counts.

## Features

- **Object Sorting**: The system sorts objects into four bins based on their color and weight.

- **Hardware Components**: Utilizes over 7 components, including Arduino Uno, Node-MCU, HX711 Load Cell, and more.

- **Android Interface**: Features an Android-based user interface for maintaining records and displaying object descriptions and counts.

## Technologies Used

The project incorporates the following technologies:

- **Embedded C**: Used for programming the microcontrollers and sensors to control the hardware components.

- **Java (Android)**: The Android-based interface is developed in Java, providing a user-friendly way to interact with the system.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for real-time data storage and synchronization, making it easier to manage and access data from the Android interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Color and Weight Sensing Object Sorting Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-weight-sensing-sorting-model.git

2. Set up the necessary hardware components, including Arduino Uno, Node-MCU, and HX711 Load Cell, and ensure they are properly connected.

3. Install the Android application on your mobile device and connect it to the system.

4. Start using the system to sort objects based on their color and weight.

## Usage
1. Launch the Android application and connect it to the hardware system.

2. Place objects on the sensing platform and initiate the sorting process using the Android interface.

3. The system will sort objects into four bins, and the Android interface will display object descriptions and counts in real time.

4. Customize and configure the system to meet your specific sorting requirements and object categories.
